# information-propagation-control-OSN
Code-Dump of Project. 

The code creates a dictionary of randomised values for number of users configurable via config file and number of weeks configurable via config
file and save it as a pickle file in data folder. There is no code to do qualitative analysis yet.

For example if there were 2 users for 3 weeks

{0:[r01, r02, r03], 1:[r11, r12, r13]}

A data structure like this will be generated and stored. The random range is configurable through the config file.
